# Starting from 2021


Picking up the pieces of the past life wondering how we got here. A year ago, I saw atop a mountai facing off the skyline, just a distance away from the city center. I could picture my life soaring, rising above mere mortals, drifting into the vast emptiness of the sky, pitching its tent as the sole owner of the wind.

## That's just the start
